0
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,800
Have you got color in your cheeks?

1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,400
Do you ever get that feelin'
that you can't shift the tide

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,400
That sticks around like
summat's in your teeth

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,100
Ah, there's some aces up your sleeve

4
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,200
Have you no idea that you're in deep

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,700
I dreamt about you nearly
every night this week

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,700
How many secrets can you keep?

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,200
'Cause there's this tune I
found that makes me think of
you somehow

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,900
When I play it on repeat

9
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,200
Until I fall asleep

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Spilling drinks on my settee

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,700
(Do I wanna know?)

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,000
If this feeling flows both ways

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
(Sad to see you go)

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,000
(Baby we both know)

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,700
That the nights were mainly
made for saying

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Things that you can't say tomorrow day

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Crawlin' back to you

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,900
Ever thought of calling when
you've had a few?

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,100
'Cause I always do

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:55,100
Maybe I'm too busy being yours
to fall for somebody new

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,700
Now I've thought it through

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,700
Crawling back to you

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,300
So have you got the guts?

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,400
Been wondering if your heart's
still open and

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,400
If so I wanna know what time it shuts

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,300
Simmer down and pucker up

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm sorry to interrupt it's
just I'm constantly

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,600
On the cusp of trying to kiss you

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I don't know if you feel the
same as I do

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But we could be together, if
you wanted to

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,400
(Do I wanna know?)

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,200
If this feeling flows both ways

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
(Sad to see you go)

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,300
(Baby we both know)

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,900
That the nights were mainly
made for saying

38
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,300
Things that you can't say tomorrow day

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,300
Crawling back to you

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Crawling back to you

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,900
Ever thought of calling when
you've had a few? (calling
when you've had a few)

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,200
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Maybe I'm too busy being yours
to fall for somebody new

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Now I've thought it through

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,100
Crawling back to you, (do I wanna know?)

46
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,200
If this feeling flows both ways

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,100
(Sad to see you go)

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,800
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
(Baby we both know)

50

That the nights were mainly
made for saying

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Things that you can't say tomorrow day

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
(Do I wanna know?)

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
Too busy being yours to fall

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
(Sad to see you go)

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,300
Ever thought of calling darling?

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,100
(Do I wanna know)

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Do you want me crawling back to you?

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:20,300
